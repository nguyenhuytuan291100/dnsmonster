# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Any version before 1.0.0 is considered unstable and unsupported. After 1.x.x release, Major supported versions will be the latest one in each 1.x.

For example, 1.2.1 is the first relaese of 1.2, and 1.2.2 is the next one. The only supported version is the latest, which is 1.2.2.

For each breaking release (eg 1.2.x to 1.3.x), the aim is to support two versions before, and backport security patches.
For example, when 1.9.x is released, 1.9.x and 1.8.x will get support, and 1.7.x will fall out of support automatically.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Since this is a DNS packet capture tool, a certain type of bug in parser could result in a major and potentially global breach.
In case of these types of issues, please email me directly (my email is available in my GitHub profile). As the project grows, this ad-hoc method will be replaced.
