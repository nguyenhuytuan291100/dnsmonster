  Getting Started with dnsmonster
---

Passive DNS monitoring framework built on Golang. 
`dnsmonster` implements a packet sniffer for DNS traffic. It Ability to accept traffic from a `pcap` file, a live interface or a `dnstap` socket, 
and Ability to be used to index and store hundreds of thousands of DNS queries per second as it has shown to be capable of indexing 200k+ DNS queries per second on a commodity computer. It aims to be scalable, simple and easy to use, and help
security teams to understand the details about an enterprise's DNS traffic. `dnsmonster` doesn't look to follow DNS conversations, rather it aims to index DNS packets as soon as they come in. It also doesn't aim to breach
the privacy of the end-users, with the ability to mask Layer 3 IPs (IPv4 and IPv6), enabling teams to perform trend analysis on aggregated data without being able to trace back the queries to an individual. [Blogpost](https://blog.n0p.me/dnsmonster/)
